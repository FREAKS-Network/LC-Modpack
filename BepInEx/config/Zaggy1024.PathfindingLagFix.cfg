## Settings file was created by plugin PathfindingLagFix v2.1.1
## Plugin GUID: Zaggy1024.PathfindingLagFix

[Behavior]

## How nodes should be selected if the criteria for a distance based pathfinding operation (i.e. bracken evasion) fails.
## 
## UsePreset: Use the option selected by the current preset.
## BestPathable: The enemy will go to the furthest/closest node that can be reached. This is the old behavior of PathfindingLagFix, and it guarantees the bracken will not get stuck when spotted.
## Vanilla: The enemy will attempt to go to the furthest/closest node, regardless of whether it can be reached. This will cause brackens to sometimes stutter step towards the furthest position instead of moving smoothly.
## DontMove: The enemy will not move until it has a valid path to follow. For the bracken, this will result in it standing still and looking at the player until they look away.
# Setting type: DistancePathfindingFallbackNodeSelectionType
# Default value: UsePreset
# Acceptable values: UsePreset, BestPathable, Vanilla, DontMove
DistancePathfindingFallbackNodeSelection = UsePreset

## Selects whether to set the mostOptimalDistance field containing the distance to the selected node at the site where the vanilla async distance pathfinding is used.
## 
## When enabled, this will fix the vanilla bug where the bracken will stand still or walk slowly towards a player instead of retreating if it is spotted within 5 units.
# Setting type: AsyncDistancePathfindingMostOptimalDistanceBehaviorType
# Default value: UsePreset
# Acceptable values: UsePreset, Set, DontSet
AsyncDistancePathfindingMostOptimalDistanceBehavior = UsePreset
