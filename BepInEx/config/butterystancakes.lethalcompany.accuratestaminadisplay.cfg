## How the stamina meter displays exhaustion. You become exhausted when stamina hits 0% or if you release the sprint key while stamina is 20% or lower.
## "Empty" will make the stamina bar display as empty for the last 20% of stamina, just like the original game. "ChangeColor" will turn the bar red when you are currently exhausted. "AlwaysShow" will always display the last 20% of the bar as red. "DontShow" will not display any special indicator for exhaustion.
# Setting type: String
# Default value: AlwaysShow
