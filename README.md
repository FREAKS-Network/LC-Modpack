### This is the Vanilla Edition of our modpack, and it is compatible with the v50! Compare to our [original version](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/FREAKS/FREAKS_Modpack/), the VE does not add new items, mobs and mechanics to the game, preserving the vanilla experience to be fully playable, still, with some mods that improve QoL of the game.



![installation.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FREAKS-Network/LC-Modpack/VE-1.2.3/resources/img/installation.png)

Install and setup [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ebkr/r2modman/), then click on the `Install with Mod Manager` button right above.

> ### Do not forget to click on `Update all` inside the yellow banner in the `Installed` tab of [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ebkr/r2modman/) if you need to after the installation, and aslo everytime you want to launch and play LC with people using this modpack.
> Please note that whenever the modpack gets an update, we recommend you (and your friends) to create a clean new profile into [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ebkr/r2modman/) and reinstall the modpack from this webpage or in the mod browser of [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ebkr/r2modman/) to avoid any conflict inbetween newer and older version of mods updates, removed mods and added mods.

![custom_boombox.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FREAKS-Network/LC-Modpack/VE-1.2.3/resources/img/custom_boombox.png)

We have included our custom boombox musics/sounds, thanks to the [Custom Boombox Music](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Steven/Custom_Boombox_Music/) mod by [DeadlyKitten](https://github.com/DeadlyKitten). Some of them can be **NSFW**! As well for some custom posters inside the ship, so if you are streaming with this modpack, be carefull!
