The modpack includes our recommended configurations for the mods. You can customize these settings using the `Config editor` tab in [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ebkr/r2modman/) or [Thunderstore Mod Manager](https://www.overwolf.com/app/thunderstore-thunderstore_mod_manager), or by utilizing [LethalConfig](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/AinaVT/LethalConfig/) directly in the game.

**Disclaimer:** Server-sided mods must be enabled for all players joining a lobby hosted by someone using these mods.
