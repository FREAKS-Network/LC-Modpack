## Client-sided and Server-sided mods
Some of the mods are client-sided only, and are here to improve game QoL mostly... But may you don't like some, so as they are client-sided mods, most of them can be disabled and you can still play with other players as long as you have the server-sided mods of the host of the game are enabled on your side. You can't disable server-sided mods and play with someone that is hosting a lobby with the presumed disabled server-sided mods!
