### This modpack is the new version of the [FREAKS Modpack](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/FREAKS/FREAKS_Modpack). This version is lighter, and does not add new moons, interiors, mobs, items and mechanics, keeping (sort of) the vanilla way of playing Lethal Company.
Even though this modpack aims to be vanilla-like, it does add some stuff such as:
- Reserved Flashlight/Walkie as well toggleable hotkeys
- A `sell` terminal command for people that want to speedrun the selling part of the game. *(Optional freature)*
- Advanced ship screens
- Headcam/Bodycam ship screen
- Some HUD tweaks such as:
  - Rendertext of the total scrap value inside the ship
  - Rendertext of the total indoor scrap count/value *(basically the `scan` terminal command but always shown on HUD)*
  - Accurate stamina bar *(As well as TZP effect colors)*
  - Item capacity bar *(TZP, Weed Killers...)*
  - Player health metrics
  - Hiden chat
  - Lighning icon indicator in the hotbar for items that are going to be stroke by lightning
- Ship windows that can be closed/opened (AI/Enemies can see though windows!)
- Jump delay removal
- Hidden player names
- Uncapped player limit (over 32 players)
- Synchronized skinwalker voices as well as player-like Mimics (custom suits, cosmetics, no mask, no arms...)
- A new orbit space decor, openable ship doors, animations and beautiful moons and skyboxe preview while in orbit
- A few mods that fixes bunch of issues from Lethal Company, such as clipping items and broken AI
- Also some mods that improve framerates and preformances, adds culling to facility/mansion tiles for example
- Faster hotbar scrolling speed and fast item drop mechanic
- A lot of custom suits and cosmetics for MoreCompany, default suits unlocked by default too
- A lot of emotes, usable with <kbd>1</kbd> to <kbd>0</kbd> keybinds or <kbd>V</kbd> for over +200 "Fortnite" emotes
- Faster cruiser/item dropship landing
- Overhauled spectator mode, zoom/unzoom with scrollwheel, togglelable Flashlight and Nightvision overlay
