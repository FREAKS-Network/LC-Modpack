### This modpack is a fork of [FREAKS Modpack Vanilla Edition](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/FREAKS/FREAKS_Modpack_Vanilla_Edition/) and is meant to be played by players that want to play Lethal Company in a 100% vanilla-like way.
This only changes few things that only improve QoL like:
- Toggleable Flashlight/Walkie hotkeys
- A `sell` terminal command for people that want to speedrun the selling part of the game. *(Optional freature)*
- Advanced ship screens
- Some HUD tweaks such as:
  - Rendertext of the total scrap value inside the ship
  - Rendertext of the total indoor scrap count/value *(basically the `scan` terminal command but always shown on HUD)*
  - Accurate stamina bar *(As well as TZP effect colors)*
  - Item capacity bar *(TZP, Weed Killers...)*
  - Player health metrics
  - Hiden chat
  - Lighning icon indicator in the hotbar for items that are going to be stroke by lightning
- A few mods that fixes bunch of issues from Lethal Company, such as clipping items and broken AI
- Also some mods that improve framerates and preformances, adds culling to facility/mansion tiles for example
- Faster hotbar scrolling speed and fast item drop mechanic

> Nothing more than what as been listed above changes the games mechanics or add features to it. That's all of it.
