> **If you have any suggestions or ideas of what we can improve for thoses changes for Lategame Upgrades, feel free to make an issue on the [GitHub](https://github.com/SKAREZ/FREAKS-Modpack/issues) page! We will check on it.** 
> - We wanted Lategame Upgrades to be less harder, especially upgrades costs that were too overrated for the reward it gives. This mod adds plenty of new mechanics and items that needs to be playable more often even in early/mid game... So we made a few tweaks depending of what the upgrades and their different tiers gives, that we think are fair enough, some of are still subjects to change.
